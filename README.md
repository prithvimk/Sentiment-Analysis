# Sentiment-Analysis

I have used the Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products)

The objective of the project is to build a Sentiment Classifier with a pretrained NLP model called BERT.

The notebook is to be run on Google Colab using the GPU for faster training.
